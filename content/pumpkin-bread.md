## Instructions

Pre-heat oven to 325Âº

Grease 2 4x8 loaf pans with butter and then dust with flour

In a medium bowl, combine salt, flour, baking soda, baking powder, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.

Whisk until combined and set aside.

In a large bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter and sugar on a medium speed until just blended. Add eggs one at a time beating well after each addition. Continue beating until very light and fluffy (A few minutes.) Then beat in the pumpkin.

Add the flour mixture and mix on low speed until combined.

Turn the batter into the prepared pans, divide evenly and bake for 65-75 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean.

Let the loaves cool in the pans for 10 minutes then turn on to a wire rack to cool completely.

And enjoy ðŸ™‚
