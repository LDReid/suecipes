## Equipment
- Chef's Pan

## Instructions

Combine the chicken, Cajun seasoning and salt. Heat the butter and oil in a large pan (a Chef's pan with a lid is ideal) and pan fry the chicken until it starts to color.

Add the onion, garlic, sun-dried tomatoes, tomato paste and stir to combine. Cook over low heat for five minutes, stirring frequently.

Stir in the orzo, cook for a minute or so then add the chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, cover the pan and cook for about 20 minutes, stirring frequently. Orzo absorbs liquid readily so keep an eye on the pan and add a little extra water, as needed, if the pan gets too dry.

Uncover the pan and test the orzo – it should be almost tender but with a little bite to it. Stir in the shredded spinach so that it wilts.

Stir in the cream and add the grated Parmesan. You should have a deliciously indulgent creamy dish. Check the seasoning and serve with extra Parmesan cheese.

## Notes

This creamy Cajun chicken orzo tastes best as soon as cool enough to devour! Leftovers will keep for a couple of days in the fridge. To reheat, add a splash of water or broth and bring to a simmer in a saucepan. Alternatively reheat in a microwave until piping hot, stirring halfway through.
