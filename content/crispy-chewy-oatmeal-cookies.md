## Instructions

Preheat oven to 350F

Line 3 large baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside (or use 1 baking sheet, and switch them out and bake cookies in batches)

In the bowl of your electric mixer, cream butter and both granulated and brown sugars together until light and fluffy.

Add egg and vanilla and beat until well blended.

In a medium bowl, combine flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder, cinnamon and nutmeg.

Mix into butter mixture.

Remove bowl from mixer, and fold in the oats.

Using a cookie scoop (for uniform sized cookies), scoop onto a prepared baking sheet - at least 2 inches apart.

Flatten each cookie with a glass or cup dipped in sugar. Cookies should be about a quarter inch thick (ish).

Bake for 10-12 minutes. Edges should be JUST slightly browned.

Refrigerate dough between baking times (if you don't have enough cookie sheets to bake them all at once)

Let cool 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

Devour.
