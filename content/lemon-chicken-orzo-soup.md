## Preparation

Chop celery finely, peel and chop carrots finely, chop onion, and mince garlic.

## Instructions

SautÃ© the celery, carrots, and onions, in a large soup pot with the butter and oil over medium-high heat for 5-7 minutes

Stir in the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds, then add the flour and cook for another minute or so.

Pour in chicken broth and stir until the flour has dissolved, then add the Italian seasoning and chicken. Bring the soup to a boil

Cover the soup (lid slightly ajar,) and reduce the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.

Stir in the orzo and cook for another 10 minutes or until the orzo is cooked through. Keep the lid off and stir it fairly often so it wont stick to the bottom of the pot.

Take the chicken out of the pot and cut it up, then add it back in. Add the lemon juice. (Some may opt for more lemon juice then suggested for more lemony flavour.) Add parsley and season the soup with salt and pepper as needed.

Serve immediately and enjoy ðŸ™‚
