## Instructions

Preheat the oven to 160C/325F and spray an 8x8 inch square pan with cooking spray. Cut two strips of grease proof paper and place them across the pan each way. Make sure there's enough overhang on each strip to lift the bars out.

Place the butter and sugar into a large bowl, or the bowl of your stand mixer, and beat on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. This will take around 2 minutes.

Add in the vanilla, salt and flour and mix on medium speed until the dough comes together into larger lumps. Some smaller and some larger lumps are fine. You'll need to mix the dough for a good minute or two. It will first become crumbs, then as you continue to mix it will come together.

Place 3/4 of the dough mixture into your prepared pan and press into an even layer in your pan. I spray the base of a measuring cup and use the base to press the dough into the pan.

Place the base into the oven for 12-15 minutes until it's puffy. You don't want it to have any colour, just to have puffed up and not look totally raw.

Place the jam/preserves into a small, heat proof bowl, and microwave for 30-45 seconds, just until it's easy to spread. Spoon the jam over the hot base and smooth into an even layer, do your best to cover the base, there should be plenty to get a decent layer.

Take the remaining dough in your hands and crumble it on top of the jam. It doesn't matter if it doesn't cover the jam, it's not meant to. Little bits of jam peeking through adds to the look of these!

Place the pan back into the oven for 27-32 minutes, until the jam is bubbling around the edges and the top is very lightly golden. It shouldn't be golden all over, just on the highest points, the rest will look matte in the oven light.

Leave to cool in the pan completely, then gently lift out of the pan onto a cutting board. Slice into 9-12 bars and dig in.

Strawberry Jam Crumble Bars will keep in an airtight container, at room temperature, for 4 days.
