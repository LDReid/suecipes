## Instructions

Begin by cooking the pasta in a large pot according to package directions. Add the broccoli into the pasta pot 1 minute before turning off the heat. Drain, set aside.

Add the parmesan, cream, pesto, and salt & pepper. Simmer mixture for 2-3 minutes. Add the cooked pasta and broccoli. Stir until fully combined. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and garnish with more parmesan. Enjoy!
