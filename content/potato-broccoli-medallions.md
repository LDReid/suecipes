## Instructions

Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper.

Peel and chop the potatoes into 1/2" chunks, drop into a medium-sized saucepan that has a tight fitting lid and has been filled with cold water. Set over medium-high heat, covered, bring up to a boil and simmer for 10-12 minutes, until fork tender. Remove potatoes from boiling water to a large mixing bowl to cool slightly.

Rinse out the potato pot, fill with cold water and broccoli florets. Cover and bring up to a boil, remove from heat and steam until fork tender, about 3-4 minutes. Drain broccoli and move to a cutting board, dice finely when cool enough to handle.

Meanwhile, pour the cream over the potatoes, season with salt and pepper. Coarsely mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Stir in the broccoli, cheese, green onion, and egg.

Place a 3" diameter biscuit cutter on the parchment-lined cookie sheet. Scoop a heaping tablespoon into the cutter and gently flatten with a spoon. Remove the cutter and continue with the mixture, until it is all gone.

Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown on top and bottom. Let cool slightly and serve. Excellent served with mayo seasoned with a bit of chipotle chili powder.
