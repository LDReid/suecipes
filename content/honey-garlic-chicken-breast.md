## Instructions

Cut the breasts in half horizontally to create 4 steaks in total. Sprinkle each side with salt and pepper.

Place flour in a shallow dish. Coat chicken in flour and shake off excess.

Melt most of the butter in a large skillet over high heat - hold back about 1 tsp for later.

Place chicken in skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until golden. Turn and cook the other side for 1 minute.

Turn heat down slightly to medium high.

Make a bit of room in the pan and add garlic and top with remaining dab of butter. Stir garlic briefly once butter melts.

Add vinegar, soy sauce and honey. Stir/shake pan to combine. Bring sauce to simmer, then simmer for 1 minute or until slightly thickened.

Turn chicken to coat in sauce. If the sauce gets too thick, add a touch of water and stir.

Remove from stove immediately. Place chicken on plates and drizzle over remaining sauce.

## Notes

### Gluten free
Use cornflour/cornstarch instead. It won't brown quite as evenly but once covered in sauce, you won't know the difference.

### Soy Sauce
Light or all purpose soy sauce is suitable for this recipe. I don't recommend using Dark Soy Sauce (flavour will dominate, bottle label will say if it is Dark Soy Sauce).

### Other proteins
This sauce is ideal to use for any protein that is suitable for searing in a pan. Use chops, steaks, cutlets! Follow the recipe as written, including dusting the protein with flour. Just adjust the cook time - the trick is to add the garlic and other sauce ingredients before it is fully cooked through, so the meat finishes cooking as the sauce reduces down into a syrupy consistency.

### Tofu
Use FIRM tofu. Cut "steaks" about 0.75cm/1/4" thick. Pat dry, spray or rub with oil, sprinkle with salt and pepper, THEN lightly coat with flour. Coat base of skillet with oil over medium high heat, then cook tofu 1 min each side until crispy, then remove onto paper towels. Then make the sauce in a small saucepan or skillet using just 2 tbsp (30g) butter (instead of 3.5 tbsp), following recipe from Step 5. Serve with crispy tofu!

### Prawns/shrimp
Use large prawns (thaw, drain well and pat dry if using frozen). Lightly coat prawns with flour per recipe and sear for 1 minute on the first side, then just 30 seconds on the other side before proceeding with Step 5.

### Fish
Cook per recipe for chicken breast. This sauce is very, very good with fish! This is a good sauce for economical fish because it's a strong flavoured sauce. For expensive fish, I think it's better to let the flavour of the fish come through and serve with an elegant sauce like this Lemon Butter Sauce.

### 4. Nutrition
323 calories per serving, assuming you scrape every drop of sauce from the pan, and why wouldn't you? :)
